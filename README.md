# Engineering-Manager-Resources
Collection of Managerial Case Studies: Handling Scenarios in Team, Individual, Project, Product, Leadership, and More.

## What
A bunch of managers come together to chat about the tough situations they face at work. They shared stories of how they
dealt with those moments – what worked, what didn't, and the lessons they learned. Other managers in the group listen in,
sharing their own advice if they've faced similar situations. This collection is like a treasure trove of real experiences,
showcasing how things were handled in the field. 

Anyone can pitch in, add new stories, or give their take on existing ones.

## Why
In the world of managerial literature, many books cover different situations and how to handle them. Yet, finding a
scenario that truly matches your unique context can be a real struggle. This open repository aims to change that. It's
a place where we all will help build a catalog of real stories, so anyone can easily find situations that closely matches 
their own. No more sifting through pages – just practical solutions right at our fingertips. Feel free to join in, share
your experiences, and help others navigate their challenges too.

## How
Every scenario is categorized with a title, context, approach (one or many). An approach could have positives, challenges
and potential pitfalls.

Ideas to improve are welcome!
